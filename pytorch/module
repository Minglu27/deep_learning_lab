5.1
There are three methods to define modules based on nn.Module: Sequential, ModuleList and ModuleDict
Sequential(nn.Sequential) can use an ordered dictionary(OrderedDict).
ModuleList(nn.ModuleList) can receive module as input, its operation likes List's. 
But ModuleList does not have order, it should use 'forward' function to set the order of modules it stored.
ModuleDict(nn.ModuleDict) likes ModuleList. And it can easier to add layer.
